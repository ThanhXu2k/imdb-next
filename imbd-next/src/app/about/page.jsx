        The story follows writer and performer Richard Gadds warped relationship
        with a female stalker and the impact it has on him as he is ultimately
        forced to face a deep, dark buried trauma.

        I couldnt help but cry at those scenes, the angst and disgust were
        almost unbearable, and to think that there are some many evil people in
        the world just like that makes my skin crawl. Watching Donnys processing
        of what happened to him felt really familiar and accurate, as its often
        really convoluted and confusing as it was depicted on the show. His
        portrait of the shame aspect of it, as it takes a huge toll on the
        victims life, was incredibly faithful and well-done.
